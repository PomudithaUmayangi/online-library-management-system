## 📖 Project Overview

This project is part of the **IE2042 – Database Management Systems for Security** module in the **B.Sc. (Hons) in Information Technology specializing in Cyber Security** at **SLIIT**.

### 💡 Key Highlights:
- Provides services for borrowing, reserving, and donating items.
- Utilizes SQL queries to create, manage, and secure a database.
- Implements triggers, views, and procedures for advanced database functionality.
- Analyzes vulnerabilities like SQL injection and DoS attacks and suggests mitigation strategies.

## 🛠️ Features and Implementations

### 1️⃣ **Database Design and Implementation**
- **ER Diagram and Schema:** Models relationships and structures in the library system.
- **Tables:** Comprehensive table creation with relationships, constraints, and normalization.

### 2️⃣ **Data Management**
- **Data Insertion:** Prepopulated demo values for testing and validation.
- **Triggers:** Ensure specific conditions are met before data insertion.
- **Views:** Control access levels based on user roles.
- **Indexes:** Enhance query performance.
- **Stored Procedures:** Automate common operations securely.

### 3️⃣ **Security Enhancements**
- Analysis and mitigation of:
  - **SQL Injection:** Prevention techniques like parameterized queries and input validation.
  - **Denial of Service (DoS):** Strategies like rate limiting, firewalls, and protocol filtering.

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### SQL Injection Mitigation:
- Use **prepared statements** and avoid dynamic queries.
- Sanitize and validate user input to block harmful data.
- Implement **stored procedures** to prevent query manipulation.
- Secure database configurations and limit user permissions.

### DoS Attack Mitigation:
- Employ **rate limiting** to control traffic.
- Use **web application firewalls (WAF)** to filter malicious requests.
- Secure protocols and limit oversized packets.
- Regularly update software and apply security patches.
